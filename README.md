This covers C195 Software 2 Advanced java applications


Technical Specs: This projectuses Java as the Programming language, SceneBuilder for the GUI elements, and MySQL for database storage.

Purpose of the project: The purpose of the project was to create an appointment scheduler application that will allow the user to add customer to the database, edit their information, or delete them from the database as well as add new appointments to the database, edit
exisiting appointments in the database, or delete appointments entirely. This application can also generate reports based off specific queries in the code, in the application there are currently 4 but can be changed to include more depending on the need. The 4 different 
reports that can be generated are the Total by Month, Total by Type, Contact Schedule, and Appointment by Country. This application is also protected by username and password protection, if the user does not enter the correct password or username they will not be able to
access the application. (Username and Passwords are in the SQL database in a table listed Users) The application also includes a login activity log that displays the login attempts, the dates they were attempted, the time zone, time and whether the attempt was a fail or not.
This application also allows for the login screen of the application to be displayed in a different language based on the preferred language on the users computer (The current langauges accepted are English and French)

All information for running the application are included in a README.txt in the project file
